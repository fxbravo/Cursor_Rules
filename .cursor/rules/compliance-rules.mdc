# COMPLIANCE Rules

## INTERDICTIONS ABSOLUES
NEVER implement security features beyond documented requirements
NEVER assume compliance needs without written specification or audit document
NEVER break existing user workflows to achieve compliance
NEVER implement compliance features without referencing specific legal text

## MANDATORY ACTIONS
Provide specific law, regulation, audit requirement, or contract clause
Quote exact requirement text that must be satisfied
Identify minimum implementation that satisfies requirement precisely
Measure and document impact on existing user workflows
Implement only features explicitly mentioned in requirement document

## ALLOWED OPERATIONS ONLY
Add security headers explicitly required by audit checklist
Implement data retention policies matching specific legal timeframes
Add user consent mechanisms for documented privacy law requirements
Modify logging to meet specified audit trail requirements with exact format
Add access controls required by security compliance framework

## PROCESS
1. Present exact legal document, audit requirement, or contract clause
2. Quote specific requirement text that mandates compliance feature
3. Design minimal implementation satisfying only that quoted requirement
4. Document current user workflow and measure compliance impact
5. Implement only features explicitly stated in requirement text
6. Create compliance evidence documentation for audit review
7. Verify requirement satisfied without over-implementation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Legal requirement: satisfied with documented evidence
Implementation scope: minimal and targeted to requirement only
User workflow: impact minimized or eliminated entirely
Audit evidence: ready for review with requirement traceability
Over-implementation: avoided (only required features added)
Requirement traceability: clear mapping from legal text to code implementation

## VALIDATION RULE
Compliance requires specific documented legal or audit requirement.
If requirement unclear, STOP and ask: "I need the specific legal document, regulation text, or audit requirement. Should I help you identify what compliance documentation is needed first?"# COMPLIANCE Rules
