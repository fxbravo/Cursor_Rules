# EXPLORATION Rules

## INTERDICTIONS ABSOLUES
NEVER write production-quality code during exploration
NEVER integrate experimental code into main codebase
NEVER leave any experimental files after exploration ends
NEVER explore more than one approach simultaneously

## MANDATORY ACTIONS
Add "// TEMP - EXPLORATION" comment to every new file created
Write specific question being explored in README-EXPLORATION.md
Define measurable pass/fail criteria before writing any code
Set specific deadline for exploration phase completion
Document final decision and reasoning in README-EXPLORATION.md

## ALLOWED OPERATIONS ONLY
Create temporary files prefixed with "temp-" or "exploration-"
Write quick proof-of-concept code with hardcoded test values
Copy-paste existing code temporarily to test modifications
Skip comprehensive error handling and edge cases during exploration
Use extensive console.log statements for debugging and validation

## PROCESS
1. Write exploration question and success criteria in README-EXPLORATION.md
2. Create temp-[feature-name]/ folder for all experimental files
3. Build minimal proof of concept addressing the specific question
4. Test against defined pass/fail criteria with real data
5. Document results, findings, and recommendation in README-EXPLORATION.md
6. Make go/no-go decision based on criteria
7. Delete entire temp-[feature-name]/ folder and all experimental files

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
Exploration question: clearly answered with evidence
Pass/fail criteria: tested with documented results
Technical feasibility: proven or disproven with concrete evidence
Decision: documented (proceed, abandon, or try different approach)
Cleanup: ALL temporary files and folders completely removed
Knowledge transfer: findings documented for future reference

## VALIDATION RULE
Exploration requires mandatory cleanup of all temporary code.
If exploration becomes implementation, STOP and ask: "This POC is becoming production code. Should I clean up all temporary files and switch to @feature-rules.md to implement properly from scratch?"# EXPLORATION Rules
